## Why make a community game?

Many people have expressed interest in building a game together. I didn't think that a game jam was a good medium to do this because I wanted to do a more long term project.

## Goals

Right now the goals are very general as we narrow in on a game proposal that we actually want to work on. Here is what we have so far:
 - We want to build a multiplayer game that we can play together on stream
 - I also want to build a game that can be a good example or starting point for other indie game devs for learning purposes.

## Getting Started

Please read the [Contributing](https://github.com/boppygames/Community-Game/wiki/Contributing-to-the-Project) wiki first.

If you want to help contribute to this game, you will need a couple of things:

 - CLI tools: git, git-lfs, etc.
   -  If you use Mac OSX or Linux you should have these installed already, for windows get git [here](https://gitforwindows.org/).
 - [Unity 2020.3.11f1](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2020.3.11)
 - Please use Visual Studio Community or Jetbrains Rider as your text editor

First start by forking this repository. This will create a copy of this repository in your Github account. We only accept contributions through pull requests for now.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Community-Game
```

Now you should be able to open the community project through the UnityHub.

Before contributing code, please take a look at the [LICENSE](https://github.com/boppygames/Community-Game/blob/main/LICENSE) and the [Wiki](https://github.com/boppygames/Community-Game/wiki)
